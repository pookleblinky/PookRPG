Snafu: needs a character and relationship heavy engine, a lookup table for
generating the immediate aftermath of the heist, and simple mechanics for
cinematically dealing with their situation.

Containment: a clue system for figuring out the properties of the
SCP from the preliminary field reports and field tests. Say, there's 13 pieces
of information the investigators need to know, 6 of which are core clues. In act
2, one or more of those 7 unknowns will allow the item to breach containment.
GUMSHOE could work, to ensure they'll have *some idea* of how to contain it, but
guarantee that the containment will almost certainly fail unless they were
extremely lucky. 

Cabin: Act 1: a system for building plans, designing traps and such. Players
gotta get into the mindset of the people designing the ritual. Act 2: for the
researchers, a continuation. For the players, a low-crunch cinematic system.
