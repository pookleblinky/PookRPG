# General system

Read the Dungeon World Guide and the Simple World guide to get an idea of the
basic system being used, and the links at the bottom. Powered by the Apocalypse
is an extremely flexible system, rather light in crunchiness, and encodes good
GM habits right into its rules. Most of this should make sense to some degree. 

You, as the GM, have an agenda, a set of principles that determine your actions
(not a pre-made narrative), and a limited number of moves that the players
trigger through their actions. 

# Stats used:

- Agile: reflexive/graceful
- Dynamism: persuasive/assertive
- Leverage: aggressive/forceful
- Innovation: calculating/methodical
- Synergy: Inquisitive/exploratory

# Agenda:

- Make supervillainy seem real
- Make the character's lives interesting.
- Play to find out what happens.

# Principles (right from the quickstart guide):

- Barf forth corporate supervillainy.
- Make the world seem real.
- Build a bigger world through play.
- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
- Start and end your moves with the fiction.
- Make your move, but misdirect.
- Make your move, but never speak its name.
- Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.
- Name everyone, make everyone human. 
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Be a fan of the players’ characters. 
- Think offscreen, too.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.
- Make the characters aware that they are not the protagonist. The protagonist
  is currently doing a preparation montage elsewhere, or ordering a martini on a
  Caribbean island.

# Moves (from quickstart guide):

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Put someone in a high-stakes situation.
- Trade harm for harm (as established).
- Deal harm (as established).
- Fill their inbox with corporate horrors
- Announce off-screen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their Things.
- Demonstrate one of their Things’ bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Make a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.

# Dangers, and Bigger Pictures

The supervillain has a plan that is ticking toward completion in phases. The
Good Guy has a plan that is ticking down til he bursts in spraying gunfire and
one-liners. And maybe the sharks with lasers on their heads also have a plan
ticking down toward a goal. Maybe the Legal Department is making a contract with
at elder god.

Make several clocks, with various segments. Use them liberally to produce a
vibrant supervillain organization.

# Inbox as sanity

On failed rolls, you can fill a player's inbox. As it fills, they get
increasingly bizarre, harmful, and encumbering regulations and memos. 

Note: may add in a Veil-style stress mechanic that allows players to clear out
their inboxes. Or, a Blades in the Dark style downtime phase where players can
just go about trying to work through weird action items. It really depends on
how the players want to play, so I'd prefer to keep this open and minimal so it
can be adapted however wanted.
