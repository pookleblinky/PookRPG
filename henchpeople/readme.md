# Henchpeople: the RPG

A Powered by the Apocalypse game where you play henchpeople working in a
supervillain's organization when, for whatever reason, your daily routine is
upended. Maybe you discover you are the baddies. Maybe you feel resentful about
your contributions to the death ray being neglected, and wish to moonlight your
own supervillainy operation. Maybe you just want to get out before the good guy
comes in guns blazing and one-liners tossed around.

# Session 0: Worldbuilding

Who's your boss? Why are they a supervillain? What are they trying to
accomplish? What was your job? How long have you worked here? Why don't you like
it? What are *you* trying to accomplish? How are these other people connected to
you?

# Game

Your boss has a clock counting down til their evil supervillain goal. That
countdown's got some countdowns. The Good Guy has his own clock for when he
bursts in and starts killing your coworkers and then saying oneliners. And, you
probably have some emails in your inbox that urgently need responding.
