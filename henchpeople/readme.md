# Henchpeople: the RPG

A Powered by the Apocalypse game where you play henchpeople working in a
supervillain's organization when, for whatever reason, your daily routine is
upended. Maybe you discover you are the baddies. Maybe you feel resentful about
your contributions to the death ray being neglected, and wish to moonlight your
own supervillainy operation. Maybe you just want to get out before the good guy
comes in guns blazing and one-liners tossed around.

# Session 0: Worldbuilding

Is your boss Umbrella Corp, or an Adam West era goofy supervillain? Set
expectations about what kind of game this will be. The only real requirement is
that whoever and whatever this organization is, runs as a corporation with
inboxes and HR departments and employee benefits and such. Whether you work for
Cthulhutech or Blofield, you gotta have TPS reports floating around somewhere.

Who's your boss? Why are they a supervillain? What are they trying to
accomplish? What was your job? How long have you worked here? Why don't you like
it? What are *you* trying to accomplish? How are these other people connected to
you? Which one of them has faved a picture of your cat on social media?

Players can refer to interview.md for interview questions in character
generation, and teamwork.md for establishing relationships with other
characters.

# Clocks, everywhere

Your boss has a clock counting down til their evil supervillain goal. Each
department's got a clock counting down how pissed they are at every other
department and you in particular.  That countdown's got some countdowns. The
Good Guy has his own clock for when he bursts in and starts killing your
coworkers and then saying one liners. And, you probably have some emails in your
inbox that urgently need responding.
