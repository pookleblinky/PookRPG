Here's a scenario you can use in Session 1, name inspired by Shadowrun.

PC's are gathered in the company cafeteria when a lab specimen breaks out of
containment. Flashing emergency lights, heavily armoured guards spraying bullets
indiscriminately, telekinetic kids wearing paper medical gowns, choking gas
seeping from the ceiling fixtures, chittering talons on polished floors, etc.
Coworkers being hurled through the air, devoured, or warped halfway into nearby
solid objects, whatever.

This is a normal Tuesday. PC's should not be given the opportunity to attempt to
save the day or do anything that'll get them fired. The goal is to get them to
survive what is just an average lunchbreak.
