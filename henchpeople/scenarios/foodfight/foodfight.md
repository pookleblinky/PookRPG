Here's a scenario you can use in Session 1, name inspired by Shadowrun.

PC's are gathered in the company cafeteria when a lab specimen breaks out of
containment. Flashing emergency lights, heavily armoured guards spraying bullets
indiscriminately, telekinetic kids wearing paper medical gowns, choking gas
seeping from the ceiling fixtures, chittering talons on polished floors, etc.
Coworkers being hurled through the air, devoured, or warped halfway into nearby
solid objects, whatever.

This is a normal Tuesday. PC's should not be given the opportunity to attempt to
save the day or do anything that'll get them fired. The goal is to get them to
survive what is just an average lunchbreak. 

# Setting

Because the cafeteria will depend on what kind of supervillain organization
you've come up with, I'm not going to include any layouts. Besides, it's hard to
find layouts that aren't copyrighted.

My advice: find both a layout, and an image that resembles it. Let your players
see the shiny pastel colors of the corporate cafeteria, the clean lines and
trendy chair shapes. Let them imagine the buzz of the crowd as they wait in line
beside the foozball table and the colorful mural drawn by employee children.

It's more important to get the atmosphere right than to try to simulate every
millimeter of area.

# Bystanders

Following the 7-3-1 rule, try to have 7 NPC's. These 7 NPC's will be the seeds
of the organization, so make them represent a range of departments.
