# Building your team

In session 0, you not only create your character, but determine their
relationships to other characters. Is this person your boss? Do you meet each
other outside work? Are they your arch-nemesis? etc.

You do this by answering short questionnaires.

The person who shows up the most times in friendly contexts, you get a +2
toward. Others who show up Friendly more often than Foe, get +1. PC's who are
more Foe than Friend, get a -1. This stat is increased by cooperating with other
players as mentioned below.

# Basic Questionnaire

- XXX and I have sung karaoke together. Friendly.
- I know a secret about XXX that could get them fired, and they know one about
  me. Friendly.
- I once had to fix a mistake XXX made that could have cost us millions of
  dollars. Foe.
- I am never invited to XXX's holiday parties. Foe.
- I suspect that XXX has been stealing my lunches from the breakroom. Foe.
- XXX and I still laugh about this incident. Friendly.
- XXX and I still avoid each other after this incident. Foe.
- XXX has housesat my pets. Friendly.
- I will never again let XXX pick where to eat for lunch. Foe.
- I trust XXX's fashion advice implicitly. Friendly.
- XXX and I share a secret injoke about the Boss. Friendly.
- XXX has this annoying habit that bugs me every single day. Foe.

# Experience is Cooperation

PC's don't get more powerful in a vacuum. They get more powerful by
cooperating with each other.

When a player triggers the Synergize move to help another player's move, they
roll their Teamwork stat toward the other player. If it's successful, this is
tracked. After a move has been successfully helped 3 times, that move becomes
permanently more powerful (a permanent +1 modifier, it does something special on
12+ rolls, etc) and the relevant teamwork stat bumped up by 1. With more help,
maybe a player can make a new move.
