# Basics

You're a fairly recent hire, and your job is uninspiring but hey, in this
economy you do what you can do.

You spend 8 hours or more a day pretending to not be browsing Reddit waiting for
stuff to compile. Sometimes you get to work over Christmas fixing things.

# Example build

Your boss is trying to weaponize memes. You, being a lowly codemonkey, have no
idea. You're just trying to get an API to work.

Part of your job is knowing exactly how the build process works. Or, because
you mostly hate your job you've had a lot of time to play with making your own
Obfuscated Code Contest. Maybe you can

     Throw a Monkey Wrench. When you use your knowledge of how the build system
     works to sabotage it.


Not only do you know the build process like the back of your hand, but you've
also got really good at manipulating managers. Maybe you can

     Bullshit your Boss. When you use your experience at avoiding meetings and
     passing responsibilities off to others.

On your first day you were given a top of the line dev box, the kind of thing
people in most companies dream of getting. It's *great* for playing Overwatch.
Maybe you can

     Use your Absurdly Overpowered Computer. When you use your cartoonishly nice
     computer to such as generate a hash collision on the RFID badges.
