# Basics

You're a glorified janitor. You know this, your boss knows this, the big guy
knows this. But, you're not cleaning the toilets of any company. Just to get
into work each day you need to pass by those terrifying guards, get a retinal
scan, the works. You have no idea what this place does, but obviously it's
important. Also, you *never* have to ask for a new mop. This is the best job
cleaning shit you've ever heard of.

# Example build

They hired you to push a broom, not attach lasers to sharks or make rabies
airbourne. Still, maybe you

     Are Invisible. You can walk around in plain sight with no one paying
     attention.

or you

     Can Go Anywhere. You've got a badge that opens damn near every door.
