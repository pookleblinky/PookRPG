# Basics

You're a fairly recent hire with an uninspiring job but hey, in this economy you
do what you can do.

Or you've been hacking since before some of your coworkers were born. You can
write a compiler in your sleep and you're fluent in Klingon.

# Example build

Maybe you have absolute job security. No one else will even attempt to touch
your code. You can

     Issue Ultimatums. When you make demands your boss literally cannot refuse.

Or maybe you know where all the skeletons are. You can

     Blackmail. When you can retcon how you've stashed away a company secret for
     later use, which turns out to be right now.

Maybe you're fluent in both Klingon and the Batleth, and you often recite
Shakespeare while sparring. You can

     Go Worf on a Motherfucker. When you can finally put those batleth skills to
     use.

Or maybe part of your job is knowing exactly how the build process works. You
can

     Throw a Monkey Wrench In. When you use your knowledge of the build system
     to sabotage it.

Or you're really good at the time honored art of software engineering by BS. You
can

     Bullshit your boss. When you use your experience at avoiding meetings and
     passing the buck.

Maybe the first day of work you were given an absurdly top of the line dev box,
great for playing Overwatch but overkill for compiling. You can

     Use Your Absurdly Nice Computer. When you use your cartoonishly nice
     computer to such as generate a hash collision on the RFID badges.
