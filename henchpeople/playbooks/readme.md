Structure of playbooks:

# Basics

A short blurb on who your character is, what they do, how they see the company.

# Skills

There are no skillchecks. The Utilizing Professional Resources basic move is a
placeholder that triggers when you do something related to your specialty that
can fail interestingly. A programmer shouldn't have to roll to see if they can
grep a file, a labtech shouldn't have to roll to set up a basic experiment.

The character should have 2 moves based on their professional skills. Given that
I want this to work just as well for Umbrella Corp as an Adam West villain, I'd
prefer to let players create these moves themselves as part of character
generation in session 0.

# Gear

Characters should have 1 move based on what they have as part of their jobs.
