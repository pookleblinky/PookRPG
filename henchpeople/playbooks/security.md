# Basics

This is the cushiest and strangest security job you've ever had. Your segway has
a tazer and a harpoon for some reason. You know where everyone in the building
is thanks to RFID chips they don't know they have. There's uzis in the equipment
locker and a big manual on what to do in case of "Dimensional Traversal"
whatever that is.

# Example build

Like Labtech, here's where it's helpful for you to make your own build. One of
Blofield's goons is going to be a lot different than an Umbrella paramilitary
merc.

Maybe you

     Are All-Knowing. You know exactly where everyone is on campus.

or you

     Carry a Boomstick.

or you

     Know Kung Fu.

Really, it all depends on the world-building you did.
