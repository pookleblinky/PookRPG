# Basics

You're a lab technician, and you love your job. You spend your days making
things explode, fuck, or avoid exploding. Whether it's robotics, genetic
experimentation, or building high-powered curiously human-shaped particle
accelerator cores, you're not only an expert but excited to see what'll happen.

Here's where letting players make their own moves really shines. This character
depends completely on the supervillain and their goals. Are they building a
doomsday device? Programming BLITs? Genetically engineering dinosaurs? Any
specific move I give you would necessarily lock you into a genre.

Maybe you

     Brought Your Work Home. You've got an SSH to a homebrew AI, or keep some of
     that nifty research chemical in a locket on your neck.

Or maybe you

     Are Literally Jeff Goldblum. You can retcon how you know exactly how to
     release those augmented cetaceans.
