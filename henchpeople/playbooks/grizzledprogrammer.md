# Basics

You've been hacking since before some of your coworkers were born. You know how
to write a compiler without using a keyboard, and your collection of Dungeons
and Dragons minis is terrifyingly complete.

# Example build

You have absolute job security. No one else will even attempt to touch the code
you made. Maybe you can

     Issue Ultimatums. When you make demands your boss literally cannot refuse.

Or maybe you've known for a long time that your company is doing some shady
stuff and can

     Blackmail. When you can retcon how you've stashed away a company secret for
     later use, which turns out to be right now.

While not part of your job, you are fluent in Klingon and own an authentic
batleth. You often recite Shakespeare while swinging it. Maybe you can

     Go Worf on a Motherfucker. When you can finally put all those cool batleth
     skills to use.
