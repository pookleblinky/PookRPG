Structure of playbooks:

# Basics

A short blurb on who your character is, what they do, how they see the company.

# Skills

There are no skillchecks. The Utilizing Professional Resources basic move is a
placeholder that triggers when you do something related to your specialty that
can fail interestingly. A programmer shouldn't have to roll to see if they can
grep a file, a labtech shouldn't have to roll to set up a basic experiment.

The character should have 2 moves based on their professional skills.

# Gear

Characters should have 1 move based on what they have as part of their jobs.
