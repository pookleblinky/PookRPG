# The basics

To do it, do it. When what you're doing triggers a move, you'll be asked to
roll 2d6 plus a modifier. 

Moves are triggered when there's a consequence or cost to making the wrong
decision, when they can fail interestingly. If there's no chance of failure
(stabbing a defenseless person) or success (persuading someone to give you all
their clothes and then jump into a swarm of zombies as bait), the GM can tell
you there's no need to roll for it. It'll either obviously succeed or inevitably
fail. Rolling a 12+ means you do something possible to do, exceptionally well.
It doesn't mean you do the impossible. At the same time, rolling a 1 (2 with a
-1 forward) doesn't mean you accidentally get killed Final Destination style. It
just means the GM makes what'll probably be a Hard Move. You'll get a hang of
this pretty quickly.


- 10+: success
- 7-9: success at a cost ("here's three options. Pick two.")
- 6-: failure, and the GM pulls a Move.

# Basic moves

All PC's have some basic moves they can do.

TODO: decide moves, make up corporate buzzwordy names for them

Certain items in possession can add modifiers to these rolls. If you have a
weapon, you may add +1 to an Intimidate roll, for instance. If you're trying to
fix something, having an appropriate tool could add a +1. 

Certain rolls can confer a forward modifier. If you roll +10 on Risk it All,
your next action could get a +1 modifier added to it, for instance. Whereas if
you fail, not only will the GM make a hard move but you could get a -1 modifier
for whatever you were trying to do next.

Some rolls could add a Hold, which is basically a point that can be spent in the
future for a specific purpose. I don't know how to work this in yet.
