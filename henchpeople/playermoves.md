# The basics

To do it, do it. When what you're doing triggers a move, you'll be asked to
roll 2d6 plus a modifier. 

Moves are triggered when there's a consequence or cost to making the wrong
decision, when they can fail interestingly. If there's no chance of failure
(stabbing a defenseless person) or success (persuading someone to give you all
their clothes and then jump into a swarm of zombies as bait), the GM can tell
you there's no need to roll for it. It'll either obviously succeed or inevitably
fail. Rolling a 12+ means you do something possible to do, exceptionally well.
It doesn't mean you do the impossible. At the same time, rolling a 1 (2 with a
-1 forward) doesn't mean you accidentally get killed Final Destination style. It
just means the GM makes what'll probably be a Hard Move. You'll get a hang of
this pretty quickly.


- 10+: success
- 7-9: success at a cost ("here's three options. Pick two.")
- 6-: failure, and the GM pulls a Move.

# Basic moves

All PC's have some basic moves they can do.

- Exercise Due Diligence, Agile. When you have to ignore a threat to do something.

   On result:
      - 10+: You succeed
      - 7-9: You succeed, but stumble, fumble, or freeze. GM gives you a hard
        choice or worse outcome.
      - 6-: GM makes a move

- Analyze the Opportunity, Agile. When you search a location thoroughly and
  there is an interesting consequence to not knowing the answers.

   On result:
     - 10+: Pick 3 questions to ask GM
     - 7-9: Pick 1
     - 6-: GM can throw you a curveball

   Questions:
     - What happened here recently?
     - What is the most useful thing to me?
     - What should I be wary of?
     - What is the most dangerous threat here?

- Disruptive Technology, Innovation. When you attempt to use your professional
  skills to accomplish something.

   On result:
     - 10+: You succeed
     - 7-9: You succeed, but at a cost
     - 6-: You fail, and the GM makes a move

- Bring into the Fold, Dynamism. When you try to persuade someone.

   On result:
     - 10+: You succeed
     - 7-9: You partially convince them, or they get part of it wrong
     - 6-: You fail to convince them, and GM can make a move.

- Employee Evaluations, Agile. When you try to assess another person

   On result:
     - 10+: ask 3 questions
     - 7-9: Ask 1 question
     - 6-: GM can make a move

   Questions:
     - Are they lying?
     - How do they seem to feel?
     - What do they want?
     - How can I persuade them?
     - Is their cooperation useful to me?

- Threaten to Downsize, Leverage. When you try to intimidate another person

   On result:
     - 10+: They do what you want
     - 7-9: They do what you want, but at a cost
     - 6-: GM makes a move

- Synergize, Synergy. When you help another player, they get a +1 to their move
  and their Teamwork stat toward you increases by 1.
  If you hinder them, they get a -1 to their move and their Teamwork stat toward
  you decreases by 1. 


TODO: Work on better names, add a few more basic moves. Tighten up assessing
moves.

Certain items in possession can add modifiers to these rolls. If you have a
weapon, you may add +1 to an Intimidate roll, for instance. If you're trying to
fix something, having an appropriate tool could add a +1. 

Certain rolls can confer a forward modifier. If you roll +10 on Exercise Due
Diligence your next action could get a +1 modifier added to it, for instance.
Whereas if you fail, not only will the GM make a hard move but you could get a
-1 modifier for whatever you were trying to do next.

Some rolls could add a Hold, which is basically a point that can be spent in the
future for a specific purpose. I don't know how to work this in yet.

TODO: extend this
