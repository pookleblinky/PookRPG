# The basics

To do it, do it. When what you're doing triggers a move, you'll be asked to
roll 2d6 plus a modifier. 

Moves are triggered when there's a consequence or cost to making the wrong
decision, when they can fail interestingly. If there's no chance of failure
(stabbing a defenseless person) or success (persuading someone to give you all
their clothes and then jump into the tank of cyborg sharks as bait), the GM can tell
you there's no need to roll for it. It'll either obviously succeed or inevitably
fail. Rolling a 12+ means you do something possible to do, exceptionally well.
It doesn't mean you do the impossible. At the same time, rolling a 1 (2 with a
-1 forward) doesn't mean you accidentally get killed Final Destination style. It
just means the GM makes what'll probably be a Hard Move. You'll get a hang of
this pretty quickly.


- 10+: success
- 7-9: success at a cost ("here's three options. Pick two.")
- 6-: failure, and the GM pulls a Move.

# Basic moves

All PC's have some basic moves they can do. In addition, each playbook provides
3 moves specific to the PC's occupation.

- Exercise Due Diligence, Agile. When you have to ignore a threat to do something.

   On result:
     - 10+: You succeed
     - 7-9: You succeed, but stumble, fumble, or freeze. GM gives you a hard
        choice or worse outcome.
     - 6-: GM makes a move

- Analyze the Opportunity, Agile. When you search a location thoroughly and
  there is an interesting consequence to not knowing the answers.

   On result:
     - 10+: Pick 3 questions to ask GM
     - 7-9: Pick 1
     - 6-: GM can throw you a curveball

   Questions:
     - What happened here recently?
     - What is the most useful thing to me?
     - What should I be wary of?
     - What is the most dangerous threat here?

- Consult Employee Manual, Innovation. When you need to learn what the rules
  are.

     On result:
       - 10+: Pick 3 questions to ask
       - 7-9: Pick 1
       - 6-: GM can make a move

     Questions:
       - Who's in charge here?
       - What are my responsibilities here?
       - What's the history of this rule?
       - How do people usually get around this rule?

- Utilizing Professional Resources, Innovation. When you attempt to use your
  professional skills to accomplish something.

   On result:
     - 10+: You succeed
     - 7-9: You succeed, but at a cost
     - 6-: You fail, and the GM makes a move

- Bring into the Fold, Dynamism. When you try to persuade someone.

   On result:
     - 10+: You succeed
     - 7-9: You partially convince them, or they get part of it wrong
     - 6-: You fail to convince them, and GM can make a move.

- Employee Evaluations, Agile. When you try to assess another person

   On result:
     - 10+: ask 3 questions
     - 7-9: Ask 1 question
     - 6-: GM can make a move

   Questions:
     - Are they lying?
     - How do they seem to feel?
     - What do they want?
     - How can I persuade them?
     - Is their cooperation useful to me?
     - What is their corporate responsibility in this situation?

- Threaten to Downsize, Leverage. When you try to intimidate another person

   On result:
     - 10+: They do what you want
     - 7-9: They do what you want, but at a cost
     - 6-: GM makes a move

- Synergize, Synergy. When you help or hinder another player, roll your Teamwork
  stat with them.
  
     On result:
       - 10+: They get +2/-2 on their roll.
       - 7-9: They get +2/-2 on their roll *if* you accept a cost
       - 6-: You don't affect them significantly, and GM can make a move.

     Keep track of when a move is successfully helped. When a move has been
     successfully helped 3 times, it gains a permanent +1 modifier.

TODO: Integrate how much inbox harm the GM can throw at a player for failing a
roll.

Certain items in possession can add modifiers to these rolls. If you have the
proper form, you may add +1 to an intimidation roll, for instance. If you're
trying to fix something, having an appropriate tool could add a +1. 

Certain rolls can confer a forward modifier. If you roll +10 on Exercise Due
Diligence your next action could get a +1 modifier added to it, for instance.
Whereas if you fail, not only will the GM make a hard move but you could get a
-1 modifier for whatever you were trying to do next.

Some rolls could add a Hold, which is basically a point that can be spent in the
future for a specific purpose. I don't know how to work this in yet.

TODO: extend this
