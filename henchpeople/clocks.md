There are a number of clocks in this game.

# Health clock

This normal PBtA clock tracks your physical health. 4 quadrants, the last of
which is divided into three. You may get physically damaged, but odds are you'll
get psychologically damaged much more often.

# Sanity Clock

This tracks your inbox. As it fills, you get progressively more bizarre action
items and memos until eventually you're accidentally declared legally dead or
such. 

The GM can fill your inbox on failing rolls. 

TODO: provide a version of BitD's stress to let you reduce your inbox? Make a
Downtime phase where you can just try to get through the weird stuff in your
inbox?

# Departmental clocks

These track which departments you've pissed off. As the clock fills, they take
increasingly (sometimes passive) aggressive actions against you or your
department.

# Good Guy clock

This tracks the actions the good guys are taking against your org. When it
fills, maybe they come in guns blazing and dropping witty one-liners as they try
to disable the doomsday device.
