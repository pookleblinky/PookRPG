Structure:

# Basics

A short blurb on who your character is, what they do, how they see the company.

# Skills

There are no skillchecks. There is however a Utilizing Professional Resources
move that triggers when you do something relating to your specialty. It *can*
fail, so it's not just anything vaguely related to your profession. A programmer
shouldn't have to roll to see if they can grep a file, a labtech shouldn't have
to roll to follow basic lab safety stuff.

This Utilizing Professional Resources move is a placeholder for when you know a
roll should be involved, but you're not sure. 

The character should have 2 moves based on their professional skills, specific
ones that are clearly not just the more general basic move available to
everyone.

# Gear

As above, professional resources is intentionally vague. Characters should have
one move based on what they have.
