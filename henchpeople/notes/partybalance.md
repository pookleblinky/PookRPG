Some groupings:

- codemonkey
- grizzled programmer

Both their skills overlap.

- IT
- Secretary

These skills are related.

This leaves 

- labtech
- janitor
- guard

As outliers with not much overlap. And Labtech is very broad. 

How would a game look?

     CM: I send an email to an intranet account that I placed a bot on. It
     sends me back on a burner address a map of every security camera.

     Guard: I determine exactly which security camera needs to be disabled

     Janitor: I hide the spraypaint in my cart

     Secretary: Wait, I can fake an order to have it replaced. How much of a
     window is required?

     Grizzled: only about 5 minutes, long enough for the labrat to get the
     monkey out. I'll be watching network traffic to make sure no one's in the
     immediate area, but past that it's anyone's guess.
