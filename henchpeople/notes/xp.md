Here's the thing that bugs me about XP: it's artificial, and normally oriented
toward heroes.

I'd prefer it to be more organic than "get +1 XP for failing a roll" and at the
same time, not so individual. 

A PC should get more powerful based on the help they get from others. I want the
grizzled programmer to be able to finagle ID cards for the janitor, the
secretary to be able to bump up the security guard's budget, etc. 

Power should come from PC's cooperating with each other, not by them
squirrelling away points.

There is already a mechanic for helping other PC's. One idea: track when PC's
help another's move. Once they help a move 3 times, that move becomes
permanently more powerful.
