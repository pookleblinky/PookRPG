5 stats that can be high, so these should be the basis of archetypes

# Agile: reflexive/graceful
A character with high Agile is fast on their toes, able to improvise things
quickly, notice things quickly, etc. 

High agile + high Innovation = sciencey types. 

I think a high Agile would be good for Security. 
# Dynamism: Persuasive/assertive
A character with high Dynamism is definitely not a labrat, definitely not a
codemonkey. I am thinking more like Legal or Sales/Marketing.
# Leverage: Aggressive/forceful
A character with high Leverage should have some degree of corporate power.
They're able to tell others "hey, I can get you reassigned to the eel pits" and
mean it.
# Innovation: Calculating/methodical
High innovation: definitely a grizzled programmer or lab rat.
# Synergy: Inquisitive/exploratory
High Synergy: labrat, hm.
