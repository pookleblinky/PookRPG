I am trying to think about how to set up playbooks and archetypes.

Let's pretend 4 players:

# Team A
Codemonkey
Labtech
Security guard
Janitor

# Team B
Grizzled programmer
IT
Secretary
labtech

# Team C
IT
Janitor
Secretary
Security

# Scenario

They need to break into the chem lab and sabotage a machine

# Team A

The labtech can get them access via ID card, the codemonkey can install a
stuxnet kind of malware, the security guard can fix the cam footage, and the
janitor can what? Sneak the needed supplies there without anyone paying
attention? Arrange a distraction across the campus? 

# Team B

IT can track down exactly which machines are vulnerable. Grizzled programmer can
hack into them, install malware. The secretary can obfuscate things by putting
in a fake record. The labtech can provide the details of how things are set up.

# Team C

IT and guard can determine where the surveillance cameras are vulnerable,
labtech can describe physical vulnerabilities, janitor can break the machine,
and secretary can cover their tracks by putting in a fake maintenance log.

# Jobs

It seems like there are three general phases:

- Planning
- Intrusion
- Covering tracks

Each playbook has to be somehow valuable in each of these phases.

# Planning

- Codemonkey: Can help planning by understanding the systems used
- Grizzled programmer: ditto, but may also have extracurricular skills
- IT: Analysis of network traffic, security systems, data logs, hardware orders
- Janitor: can spy on routines without being noticed, search offices
- Secretary: access to paperwork, interpretation of Janitor's data
- Guard: access to security protocols and logs, permissions

# Intrusion
- Codemonkey: can hack things
- Grizzled programmer: can hack things
- IT: Can exploit network vulnerabilities, orchestrate outages
- Janitor: can slip into places without noticing
- Secretary: can exploit to allow others access
- Guard: can provide cover, distraction

# Coverup
- All can delete data, erase logs, misdirect.

# Notes

Maybe codemonkey and grizzled programmer should be combined. Done.

# New jobs
- IT
- Janitor
- Labtech
- Programmer
- Secretary
- Guard

Programmer is now tightened up, but I feel there is space for a few more
playbooks.
