According to current rules, to successfully help Jane I only need to roll a 7.
To successfully help Todd, I'd need to roll a 12. 

The rules also don't reciprocate. 

# Idea 1

If total is positive, +1
If total is negative, -1

The highest positive score gets a +1 added on. Jane would be +2.

This is the modifier used. 

To help Jane, I'd need to roll a 8. Todd, an 11.

I roll a 8+1, and help Jane. She tracks that her move was successfully helped.

I help Jane 3x, that move gets more powerful and her Teamwork stat toward me
bumps up. 

Meanwhile Todd fucks me over, and my teamwork toward him bottoms out at -2. He'd
have to help me 6 times just to break even.
