Hm, playbooks. 

How many jobs? Apocalypse World uses 12, which seems good enough. I'll make that
a cap.

So Shadowrun has:

- street samurai
- adepts
- hackers/deckers
- riggers
- magicians
- faces

Let's try to translate that into corporate:

- Street Samurai. Highly specialized muscle. Security guards?
- Adepts. Highly specialized muscle, but by different means.
- Hackers. Obviously IT
- Riggers. Obviously engineering
- Magicians. Hm.
- Faces. Marketing/sales/legal etc.
