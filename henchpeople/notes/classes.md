Hm

- Codemonkey. Youngish programmer, competent in a few things, some nerdy
  hobbies, able to do basic pentesting and security stuff.
- Grizzled programmer. Mel. Terrifyingly competent at some stuff, has been
  playing Shadowrun longer than some of their coworkers have been alive
- IT. Knows exactly how the org runs and on whose desk things end up.
- Labtech. Can build and hack stuff
- Sanitation Engineer. Like IT, knows all the nooks and crannies.
- Secretarial Mafia. Like IT and sanitations, but with even more power. They can
  have you legally declared dead, or have Chem "accidentally" drop off a vat of
  cyanide in your office.
- Security. There's your Paul Blart guys on segways rolling around the campus,
  and then there's the much higher paid ex-Mossad guys who get called in for
  real problems.
