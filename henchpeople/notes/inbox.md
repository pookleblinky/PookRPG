I'd prefer that neither the GM nor the player has to roll dice to determine what
the inbox fills with. 

I'm thinking GM moves, organized by hardness.

There should be a track, say 4x4, that fills up. 16 possible emails each with a
general theme, that gets becomes a harder move as the track fills up. Each row
would have a theme, say Announcements, Memos, Commands, etc.

The first 4 emails would be mostly harmless and innocuous. The next 4, slightly
more threatening and disruptive. The next 4, very disturbing and interfering.
The final 4 would be career-shatteringly big memos.

As long as the GM can track how hard a move they're supposed to make, it should
be fine.
