# General System

Read the Dungeon World Guide and Simple World Guide to get a grasp of the system
used. Powered by the Apocalypse is a very flexible system, designed entirely
around players constructing the narrative as they play. The GM is there to make
things interesting, but the players are the ones who build the story.

# Stats

You have 5 stats, which can range from -1 to +2. These stats are added onto a
2d6 roll as modifiers. Don't overthink these. 

- Agile: reflexive/graceful
- Dynamism: persuasive/assertive
- Leverage: aggressive/forceful
- Innovation: calculating/methodical
- Synergy: inquisitive/exploratory

There's a sixth stat, Teamwork, to track relationships with other PC's. Look at
teamwork.md for how you build these relationships in Session 0.

# Moves

This is not D&D, you don't get to just say "I roll strength" or such. You don't
have to worry about what move is being triggered, that's the GM's job. You just
have to describe what your character is doing. 

Moves aren't triggered by everything. You don't have to roll dice to check your
pockets or such. They're triggered when you can *fail interestingly*. Many
things you do, you'll succeed at automatically as expected and there's no reason
to roll. Sometimes, circumstances mean that success isn't guaranteed. That is
when a move will be triggered. 

Every move triggers a roll of 2d6 plus appropriate modifier. 10+, you succeed.
7-9, you partially succeed but take some consequence. 6-, you fail and the GM
can make a hard move.

There are some moves everyone can do, check playermoves.md for details.

In D&D, there's a tendency for players to become murderhobos, just killing
everything they see. D&D gives you a reward for doing so: you get to roll dice
and loot and such. PBtA removes that reward: you don't roll dice to decide if
your attempt to backstab an innocent old woman succeeds or not. You're a burly
barbarian with a sword, she's a peasant and someone's grandma. Of course you
succeed, you monster. PBtA deprives the would-be murderhobo of the reward of
rolling dice, that dopamine kick from a successful gamble. Your barbarian just
does a murder and steals the withered potato she was bringing home for her
starving grandchild. You monster.

# Harm Clocks

You have 2 types of harm clocks:

1. Health clock, standard PBtA clock divided into quarters, then the last
   quarter divided into thirds.

2. Employment Prospects clocks. Your boss has a clock for whether you get fired.
   Legal has one for whether they'll sue you. Etc. You have several clocks based
   on who you are pissing off, and when they fill something unpleasant will
   happen to you. Maybe the High Energy Physics department will aim a microwave
   beam at your office. Things can and will snowball until part of the
   organization is waging a proxy way against you.
