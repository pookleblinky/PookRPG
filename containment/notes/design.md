Ok, so you play a group of SCP researchers who have access to the preliminary
field reports and basic field tests of a located SCP item. 

You have to piece together its properties and design a containment system from
it. You are almost certainly going to miss some properties unless you were
extremely lucky.

Once you've devised a containment system, you switch into a more cinematic
narrative as the object breaches containment.

Now, it'd be nice to be able to do this all in one system, not having to switch
between GUMSHOE and PBtA for instance. 

Pretty sure that PBtA could do this if you had two phases with distinct moves in
each, kind of like the Sprawl with Legwork and Action. Research and Operation?

In Research, you'd have moves appropriate to investigation, constructing tests,
building containment. In Operation, you'd have moves appropriate to working in a
lab environment.
