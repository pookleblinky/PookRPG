Apocalyptic Vignettes is its own separate repo. This is for other ideas.

AV uses a stripped down PBtA engine. I have a feeling some of the ideas here
will end up using full PBtA and more crunchiness. Containment may for instance
work well in GUMSHOE, where you have to figure out the properties of the SCP
using field notes and preliminary field tests.

PBtA was created by Meg and Vincent Baker for their game Apocalypse World, it's
an extremely flexible game engine emphasizing narrativity over mechanics and
allows a laser-like focus for telling stories within a desired genre. I'm not
sure how much PBtA is the correct amount to call a game PBtA, but I am heavily
inspired by their work.
