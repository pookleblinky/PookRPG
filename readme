Apocalyptic Vignettes is its own separate repo. This is for other ideas.

AV uses a stripped down PBtA engine. I have a feeling some of the ideas here
will end up using full PBtA and more crunchiness. Containment may for instance
work well in GUMSHOE, where you have to figure out the properties of the SCP
using field notes and preliminary field tests.
