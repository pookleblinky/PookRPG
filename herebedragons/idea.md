So, To Be a Bat is about figuring out how to roleplay something that is
absolutely not human. How do you roleplay an Ajin?

Scale it up. How do you roleplay Dunkelzahn? A GSV Ship Mind? Prepared Batman?

I remember that quote about Google, where someone said "they use bayesian
reasoning the way other companies use if statements."

Is it possible to make an RPG that uses xanatos gambits the way others use
hitting things?
