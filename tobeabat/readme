In the Ajin manga, Sato at one point cuts off his hand, deep fries it, and sends
it to the headquarters of his enemy.

Then he thoroughly kills himself so he'll regenerate from the hand sitting right
in the center of their group.

Baseline humans simply don't think like that. No amount of levels you toss at a
player is going to get them to really think in those terms.

So: what is it like to be a bat? How do you get a player to really crawl inside
the head of a character who can think like this?
