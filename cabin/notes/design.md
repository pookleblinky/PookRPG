Ok, so my idea is that you start the game by building the backstory of the
ritual, constructing the whole thing from scratch. Which elder god it
propitiates, how long it's been done the current way, who presses what lever to
release the pheromones in this location, etc.

This section, world-building, needs a mechanic to keep things on track so it
doesn't end up with bikeshedding over the color of a camera disguised as a duck
or something. I'm thinking, some form of point-buy or resources. You got 100
points to spend on the whole thing, each feature costs x points, etc. When
you're out of points, you're done building the ritual.

Once that's done, you move into the next section: 2 players are the ritual's
operators, 2-4 players are the people trapped in the ritual. The ritual
operators use the moves and mechanics developed in the first half, to try to
keep the system on track.

Now, you could stagger things: 8 players total. 4 build this week's ritual for
the other 4 to walk through, and then switch next time. You're gonna need some
way to keep metagaming from messing things up too much. However: assuming 4
people build the ritual, and the people trapped inside it don't have access to
the schematics and notes and such, it may work. 

Or, insert a step between these two sections where things are somewhat
randomized. Make a few cards to randomly assign to characters at random points,
"Why not go swimming?" etc. This could help kick things along. "You found a book
of matches" or such.
