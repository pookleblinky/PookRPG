# General system

Buy Tim Waggoner's Necropolis Archives to get an idea of the setting.

Read the Dungeon World Guide and the Simple World guide to get an idea of the
basic system being used, and the links at the bottom. Powered by the Apocalypse
is an extremely flexible system, rather light in crunchiness, and encodes good
GM habits right into its rules. Most of this should make sense to some degree. 

You, as the GM, have an agenda, a set of principles that determine your actions
(not a pre-made narrative), and a limited number of moves that the players
trigger through their actions. 

# Stats used:

- Cool: reflexive/graceful
- Hot: persuasive/assertive
- Tough: aggressive/forceful
- Streetwise: calculating/methodical
- Weirdwise: Inquisitive/exploratory

# Agenda:

- Make Necropolis feel real.
- Make the character's lives interesting.
- Play to find out what happens.

# Principles 

- Barf forth nightmares.
- Make the world seem real.
- Build a bigger world through play.
- Create interesting dilemmas, not interesting plots.
- Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
- Make your move, but misdirect.
- Make your move, but never speak its name.
- Look at your NPCs and ideas through crosshairs.
- Name everyone, make everyone human. 
- Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
- Respond with challenging circumstances and occasional rewards.
- Be a fan of the players’ characters.
- Think offscreen, too.
- Sometimes, reflect a question back upon the players.

# Moves (from quickstart guide):

- Separate them.
- Put them together.
- Put someone in a high-stakes situation.
- Trade harm for harm (as established).
- Deal harm (as established).
- Announce off-screen badness.
- Announce future badness.
- Take away one of their Things.
- Demonstrate one of their Things’ bad sides.
- Give them a difficult decision to make.
- Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
- Turn their move back on them.
- Make a move from one of your Dangers or Bigger Pictures.

# Dangers and Bigger Pictures

Each of the 5 Dark Lords can become hostile to the players, similar to Corps in
the Sprawl. In addition, literally everything else in the city wants to kill the
players. There should be no shortage of grudges, threat clocks, and dangerous
locations to trigger.
