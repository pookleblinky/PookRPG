# General System

Read the Dungeon World Guide and Simple World Guide to get a grasp of the system
used. Powered by the Apocalypse is a very flexible system, designed entirely
around players constructing the narrative as they play. The GM is there to make
things interesting, but the players are the ones who build the story.

# Stats

You have 5 stats, which can range from -1 to +3. These stats are added onto a
2d6 roll as modifiers. Don't overthink these. 

- Cool
- Hot
- Tough
- Streetwise
- Weird
- Rx

# Moves

This is not D&D, you don't get to just say "I roll strength" or such. You don't
have to worry about what move is being triggered, that's the GM's job. You just
have to describe what your character is doing. 

Moves aren't triggered by everything. You don't have to roll dice to check your
pockets or such. They're triggered when you can *fail interestingly*. Many
things you do, you'll succeed at automatically as expected and there's no reason
to roll. Sometimes, circumstances mean that success isn't guaranteed. That is
when a move will be triggered. 

Every move triggers a roll of 2d6 plus appropriate modifier. 10+, you succeed.
7-9, you partially succeed but take some consequence. 6-, you fail and the GM
can make a hard move.

Here are some moves everyone can do:

- Defy Danger, relevant stat
- Fight, Tough
- Examine stuff thoroughly, Cool
- Make/fix something, Streetwise
- Do something through stress, Hot
- Persuade, Cool (or Weird where appropriate)
- Intimidate, Hot
- Read a person, Cool

Certain races, classes, and levels of augmentation provide extra moves, or
bonuses to these moves. You'll be more intimidating if you're a 10 foot tall
were-badger with titanium claws, etc.

# Relationships

Each character has a relationship to the other player characters, NPC's, and the
various organizations controlling the city.

This relationship is a separate stat, Rx.
