Read Waggoner's Nekropolis Archives.

An eternally dark city in the shape of a pentagram, in an infinite black plain
of nothingness. It's full of demons, folkloric monsters, nightmares, and
literally everything wants to kill you. The city is divided into 5 sections,
each controlled by an immensely powerful Dark Lord.

You can play a couple races: demon, lycan, vampire, arcane, etc.

You can play a couple classes: hacker, tweaker, overseer, goon, etc.

You can play with various degrees of cyberaugmentation, from normal to fully
genespliced.

Each game is a mission: find a kidnapped demon child, get incriminating evidence
on a vampire lord, etc. 

As you play, you can piss off various Dark Lords similar to corps in Sprawl.
When the clock fills up, you're probably gonna die. 

You can make alliances with Dark Lords, betray them, etc. They can and will also
betray you.

In between missions, you can take up small odd jobs around the Necropolis,
exploring the weird and dangerous little niches around it.
