Idea: your party planned a heist, which went fubar. The game starts in the
middle of things, in the moment your characters realized everything is going
wrong.

Unlike Fiasco, the whole thing takes place in the aftermath of the whole plan
falling apart.

Your getaway car got towed, your conman is dead of a shrimp allergy, 2 of you
have terrible diarrhea, and the swat team is here. Also, the mob will definitely
want to ask you questions.
